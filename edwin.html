<p>From intestinal worms to the protozoa that cause malaria, our bodies can play host to some unwelcome visitors.</p>

<div class="separator"></div>

<p class="c754_ex_instructions"><span class="b">Instructions:</span> Read each paragraph carefully. Use the list of words or phrases provided to rewrite it, improving clarity and style while retaining the original meaning. Each list includes one extra item&mdash;cross it out. Some word forms may need to change. The underlined text can be improved by rephrasing and/or shortening it for better clarity.</p>

<p>While we have explored some of the ways parasites interact with humans, intestinal worms aren’t the only unwelcome visitors that can take up residence in or on our bodies. Many other species can infect us—some living internally, while others are found externally. Furthermore, maintaining hygiene with the highest standards does not guarantee immunity, as certain parasites are capable of infecting individuals even under the cleanest of conditions.</p>


<p><span class="b">Guinea Worm:</span> Once the water flea is carrying the infective L3-stage <span data-audio-id="audio-larvae" class="word-audio">larvae</span>, it becomes a vector for transmission. Humans become infected when they drink <u>water that hasn't been filtered that contains</u> these infected water fleas. Inside the human digestive system, the water fleas are killed, and the L3 larvae are released. The larvae then go through the intestinal or stomach wall and migrate through the body to the innermost layer of skin, where they grow and <u>become mature</u> into adult worms, this happens in a period of time of around 10 to 14 months.</p>

  <div class="content-image-caption">Guinea worm (<em>Dracunculus medinensis</em>)</div>
</div>

<p>During this time, male and female Guinea worms mate inside the human host, after which the male worms die, while the fertilized females grow up to 1 meter as they mature. Once mature, the female worm moves to the skin's surface, usually in the lower limbs, where it creates a painful blister that bursts upon contact with water, releasing thousands of L1 larvae that are ingested by water fleas, continuing the cycle.</p>

<p><b>Head Lice:</b> Head lice, diminutive, wingless parasites that infest the skin of humans, are notorious for their resilience and how common they are, particularly in primary school environments where close interpersonal contact makes it easier for their transmission. These insects, which are entirely dependent on blood for their survival, feed exclusively on human blood, piercing the scalp multiple times daily to feed. Female lice exhibit remarkable reproductive efficiency, depositing up to 10 eggs (commonly referred to as nits) per day. These ova are securely affixed to the hair shafts near the scalp using a tenacious glue-like secretion, ensuring optimal warmth and protection for embryonic development. The nits typically hatch within 7-10 days, continuing the infestation cycle.</p>

  <div class="content-image-caption">Head lice (<em>Pediculus humanus capitis</em>)</div>
</div>

<p>Although head lice are not vectors of <u>diseases caused by pathogens</u>, their presence often triggers severe itching and skin abrasion from chronic scratching, which may make the host susceptible to secondary bacterial infections. Effective management necessitates a comprehensive and varied approach, including treatments using lice-killing chemicals, meticulous mechanical removal using <u>combs with fine teeth</u>, and stringent decontamination of objects and surfaces that can become contaminated by infectious pathogens such as combs, bedding, and headwear. The head louse’s adaptability and rapid reproduction underscore its persistence as a public health challenge, particularly in communal settings involving children.</p>

<p><b>Schistosoma:</b> This parasitic fluke targets freshwater snails as intermediate hosts, where its larvae (<em>cercariae</em>) develop before being released into the water. Upon contact with contaminated water, the larvae penetrate human skin, entering the bloodstream and migrating to specific organs such as the liver, intestines, or bladder, depending on the species. There, they mature, mate, and produce eggs that are excreted in human waste, continuing the cycle by infecting new snail hosts. Chronic schistosomiasis affects over 200 million people worldwide and can cause severe health problems and negative effects, including the accumulation of excess scar tissue in the liver, bladder cancer, and systemic inflammation. Effective control measures include access to clean water, <u>strategies aimed at controlling and reducing the size of snail populations</u>, and mass drug administration with praziquantel (<em>a medication that kills parasitic worms</em>).</p>

<p><b>Trypanosoma:</b> Trypanosoma is a genus of parasitic protozoa that, while affecting fewer humans than some other parasites, poses significant threats to both human and animal health. In humans, it causes diseases such as African sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis), a potentially fatal illness characterized by fever, headaches, joint pain, and neurological symptoms as the parasite crosses the layer whose function is to protect the brain. In cattle, it leads to nagana, a disease that causes anemia, weakness, and weight loss, resulting in severe economic losses in affected regions. Transmitted by tsetse flies, Trypanosoma's ability to invade the central nervous system contributes to a gradual and worsening decline of the nervous system and, without treatment, the eventual death of the host.</p>

<p><b>Toxoplasma Gondii:</b> This single-celled organism can survive within most warm- blooded animals, including humans, but it only reproduces sexually in cats. It can alter the behaviour of infected prey species, such as mice, to heighten their likelihood of being caught – it’s been suggested that it can alter human personalities, too.</p>
<p class="word_list"><span>[ _________ ]</span><span>_________</span></p>



<p><b>Scabies:</b> The description of scabies is enough to make you itch: these microscopic mites dig through skin, consuming the host as they go. They will then lay their eggs in the burrows they’ve formed. The mites are mostly transmitted by skin-to-skin contact – they conceal themselves in folds of skin and under the fingernails.</p>
<p class="word_list"><span>[ _________ ]</span><span>_________</span></p>



<p><b>Ticks:</b> Ticks are tiny arachnids. As they’re not particularly mobile, they mostly wait for their prey – any warm-blooded creature, including humans – to come to them. Once on the host, the tick cuts a hole in the host’s skin and embeds itself, where it will suck up its fill of blood. They can spread Lyme disease.</p>
<p class="word_list"><span>[ _________ ]</span><span>_________</span></p>



<p><b>Human Botfly:</b> Botfly larvae need a warm-blooded host, and sometimes that host is you. Rather than laying eggs directly in the human body, the female lays them on ticks or mosquitoes, which then transfer them to their destination. The maggots are often diagnosed when the human host feels them moving under the skin.</p>

<p>Though parasites are fascinating in their ingenuity, their presence reminds us of the delicate balance between hosts and invaders—a relationship that has shaped human history in surprising ways.</p>
